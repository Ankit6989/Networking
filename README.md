# Networking:

A computer network or data network is a telecommunications network
which allows computers to exchange data. In computer networks,
networked computing devices pass data to each other along network links
(data connections). Data is transferred in the form of packets. The
connections between nodes are established using either cable media or
wireless media. The best-known computer network is the Internet.

(**Or**)

An interconnected collection of autonomous computers is called a
computer network. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they
are able to exchange the information.

(**Or**)

A network is a set of devices (often referred to as nodes) connected by
communication links. A node can be a computer, printer, or any other
device capable of sending and/or receiving data generated by other nodes
on the network.
